# Image-Classification-in-Entomolgy

ABSTRACT:
      This Machine Learning Model is a supervised learning model which is trained in order to classify different Insect specimens. It uses the Image classification, an integral part of Computer Vision applications. This project mainly focusses on traditional methods of Machine learning with Computer Vision. The supervised learning model used for this project is the RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER. Using the algortihms and filters of Computer Vision and Digital Image processing, filter responses were recorded and were then used as features. 
<br>
These were:<br>
      1) The pixel values from different channels.
      <br>
      2) The Gray scale pixel values from images.<br>
      3) Canny edge detection filter responses.<br>
      4) Sobel edge detection filter responses.<br>
      5) Scharr, Robert and Prewitts edge detection filter responses.<br>
      6) Gabor filter bank responses.<br>
